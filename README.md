- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @richwolf…um…“Rich” is good. I live in [Edgewater][18]…a very nice place on the far north side of Chicago.
- 🤓 I’m interested in all aspects of development for [Apple][3] platforms…including [server-side Swift][4] and [Swift for AWS Lambda][5]. In addition, I try to follow trends in server-side and client-side web development…cool stuff like [Rust][9], [WebAssembly][10] and [Deno][11].
- 📚 I’m currently trying to deepen my knowledge and use of [Swift][6], [SwiftUI][7], and [Combine][8].
- 🛠 I’m looking to collaborate on projects focusing on transit…especially things involving [GTFS][12]—the General Transit Feed Specification.
- 👨🏼‍💻 To pay my bills, I implement APIs and write server-side [Node.js][13] / [Express][14] code for the [Technology Solutions][15] department of the [University of Illinois Chicago][16].
- 🎟 I’ve attended [WWDC][19] twenty-two times in person. My first WWDC was in 1994.
- 🇩🇪 Ich kann deutsch…aber leider nicht fließend.
- 🛌 Honest I’m **easily** the laziest person you know!
- 👍🏻 I **really, really** love ☕️ …and 🍺 …and 🍕.
- 🎵 And yes, I **am** learning [how to play the harp][17].
- 📫 Here’s how to reach me via [email][1] or on [Twitter][2].
