- 👋 Hi, I’m @richwolf
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of development for Apple platforms including server-side Swift and Swift for AWS Lambda. I also try to follow trends in server- and client-side web development including topics like WebAssembly and Deno.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Combine and SwiftUI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving GTFS.
- 📫 How to reach me: via [email][1] or [Twitter][2].
