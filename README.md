- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @richwolf…sorry…Rich Wolf.
- 🤓 I’m interested in all aspects of development for Apple platforms including server-side Swift and Swift for AWS Lambda. I also try to follow trends in server- and client-side web development including topics like WebAssembly and Deno.
- 📚 I’m currently learning more about Swift, SwiftUI, and Combine.
- 🛠 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving transit…and especially GTFS.
- 👍🏻 I like coffee ☕️, beer 🍺, pizza 🍕. And yes, I'm really learning how to play the harp 🎵.
- 📫 How to reach me via [email][1] or [Twitter][2].
