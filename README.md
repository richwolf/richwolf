- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m [@richwolf][1]…um either “Rich” or “Richard” is good…whichever fits you better. I live in [Edgewater][2]…a warm, fun, friendly place on the far north side of Chicago.
- 🤓 I’m interested in all aspects of development for [Apple][3] platforms…including [server-side Swift][4] and [Swift for AWS Lambda][5]. In addition, I try to follow trends in server-side and client-side web development…cool stuff like [Rust][6], [WebAssembly][7] and [Deno][8].
- 📚 I’m currently trying to deepen my knowledge and use of [Swift][9], [SwiftUI][10], and [Combine][11]. I’m also trying to come up to speed on [Android development][12] (including overcoming the [Android NDK][13])…wait, say what!?
- 🛠 I’m looking to collaborate on projects focusing on transit…especially things involving [GTFS][14]—the General Transit Feed Specification.
- 👨🏼‍💻 Until just recently, I worked with a team of very nice people over at [Helium Foot Software][15] on iOS and iPadOS applications.
- 🎓 Before working at Helium Foot, I wrote APIs and server-side [Node.js][16] / [Express][17] apps for the [Technology Solutions][18] department of the [University of Illinois Chicago][19]. I will always have a soft spot for my friends at UIC.
- 🎟 I’ve attended [WWDC][20] twenty-two times in person. My first WWDC was in 1994.
- 🇩🇪 Ich kann [deutsch][21]…aber leider nicht fließend. Servus, 🇨🇭! …🇦🇹, ich liebe dich!
- 🛌 Honest I’m **easily** the laziest person you know!
- 👍🏻 I **really, really** love ☕️ …and 🍺 …and 🍕 …and maybe a few other things that aren’t so good for me. 
- 🎵 And yes, I **am** learning [how to play the harp][22]…and oh hey, [Unicode Consortium][23], where’s that harp emoji when I need it?
- 📫 Here’s how to reach me via [email][24] or on [Twitter][25].
