- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @richwolf…um…“Rich” is good.
- 🤓 I’m interested in all aspects of development for Apple platforms…including server-side Swift and Swift for AWS Lambda. In addition, I try to follow trends in server-side and client-side web development…cool stuff like Rust, WebAssembly and Deno.
- 📚 I’m currently trying to deepen my knowledge and use of Swift, SwiftUI, and Combine.
- 🛠 I’m looking to collaborate on projects focusing on transit…especially things involving GTFS.
- 🛌 Honest I’m **easily** the laziest person you know!
- 👍🏻 I **really, really** love coffee ☕️ …and beer 🍺 …and pizza 🍕.
- 🎵 And yes, I **am** learning how to play the harp.
- 📫 Here’s how to reach me via [email][1] or on [Twitter][2].
